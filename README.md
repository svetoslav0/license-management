# Software License Management Module



### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

  

-  **Backend:** ASP.NET Core API (.NET 8)

-  **Frontend:** React 19

-  **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

-  **Database:** SQLite

  

> SQLite is used for ease of testing and setup when cloning the repository. This project was developed as part of a job interview assignment, so the goal was to ensure the environment can be spun up quickly without requiring additional infrastructure.

  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Could Have Gone Better

  

#### **Server-side**
- ‚ùå No exception handling implemented ‚Äî in a real-world project, structured error handling and proper response codes would be essential for API robustness and client clarity.

  

#### **Client-side**
- üé® The UI design was not developed at all ‚Äî it's intentionally rough and lacks polish. Visual design, layout, and usability were not prioritized due to the focus being on functional requirements for the assignment.

### üöÄ Installation & Setup

  

1.  **Clone the repository**

```bash

git clone <repository-url>

cd <repository-folder>

```

  

2.  **Run the Backend (ASP.NET Core API)**

Navigate to the `server` directory:

```bash

cd server

```

You can either use Visual Studio to start the project of just use `dotnet run` to start it. Make sure you have the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) installed.
  

The backend API should now be running at:

[https://localhost:7012/](https://localhost:7012/)

  

3.  **Run the Frontend (React)**

Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `client` directory:

```bash

cd client

npm install

npm run start

```

  

The frontend should now be running at:

[http://localhost:3009/](http://localhost:3009/)
